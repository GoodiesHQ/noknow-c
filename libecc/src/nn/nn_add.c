/*
 * This module provides conditional addition and subtraction functions between
 * two nn's:
 *
 *  o out = in1 +/- in2 if cnd is not zero.
 *  o out = in1 if cnd is zero.
 *
 * The time taken by the operation does not depend on cnd value, i.e. it is
 * constant time for that specific factor, nor on the values of in1 and in2.
 * It still depends on the maximal length of in1 and in2.
 *
 * Common addition and subtraction functions are derived from those conditional
 * versions.
 */

/*
 * Conditionally adds 'in2' to 'in1' according to "cnd", storing the result
 * in "out" and returning the carry. This is the lowest level function for
 * conditional addition.
 *
 * Note that unlike "usual" addition, the function is *in general* not
 * commutative, i.e. "_nn_cnd_add(cnd, out, in1, in2)"  is not equivalent
 * to "_nn_cnd_add(cnd, out, in2, in1)". It is commutative though if "cnd"
 * is not zero or 'in1' == 'in2'.
 *
 * Aliasing of inputs and output is possible. "out" is initialized if needed,
 * that is if not aliased to 'in1' or 'in2'. The length of "out" is set to
 * the maximal length of 'in1' and 'in2'. Note that both 'in1' and 'in2' will
 * be read to this maximal length. As our memory managment model assumes that
 * storage arrays only contains zeros past the "wlen" index, correct results
 * will be produced. The length of 'out' is not normalized on return.
 *
 * The runtime of this function should not depend on:
 *  o the value of "cnd",
 *  o the data stored in 'in1' and 'in2'.
 * It depends on:
 *  o the maximal length of 'in1' and 'in2'.
 *
 * This function is for internal use only.
